msgid "Detail2Summary"
msgstr "Determine the initial basic solution"

msgid "Detail2Description1"
msgstr "As mentioned, the Simplex method starts at a vertex of the feasible region, that is, an extreme point. With each iteration we move from vertex to vertex until we reach the optimal solution. In our case, in the prepared tableau we can see the initial basic solution, which is S₁=35, S₂=18, and S₃=26; each variable of the solution vector is set to the value found in the R column. These are called basic variables. The initial Z value is also shown in column R and is 0."

msgid "Detail2Description2"
msgstr "Variables not in the basis are called non-basic variables; in this case X₁ and X₂, both of which are 0. With this solution, do we have the best Z value? To find out, we must proceed to the next step:"

msgid "Detail3Summary"
msgstr "Select the entering variable using the optimality condition"

msgid "Detail3OptimalityTitle"
msgstr "Optimality Condition"

msgid "Detail3OptimalityDesc"
msgstr "The optimality condition checks whether the current solution in the tableau is optimal or can be improved."

msgid "Detail3OptimalityPoint1"
msgstr "In a maximization problem, if all reduced cost coefficients are ≥ 0, we are at the optimal point and the process ends."

msgid "Detail3OptimalityPoint2"
msgstr "If a linear programming problem has an optimal and finite solution, it will lie at a vertex of the convex polyhedron representing the feasible region."

msgid "Detail3OptimalityNote"
msgstr "In our maximization example, there are negative values in the reduced cost vector; therefore, we must begin iterations by selecting the entering variable."

msgid "Detail3EntryVarTitle"
msgstr "Entering Variable"

msgid "Detail3EntryVarDesc1"
msgstr "The entering variable refers to one of the non-basic variables that will enter the basis and become part of the solution."

msgid "Detail3EntryVarDesc2"
msgstr "The criteria for choosing the entering variable depend on whether the problem is maximization or minimization:"

msgid "Detail3EntryVarPoint1"
msgstr "For maximization, choose the non-basic variable with the most negative reduced cost coefficient."

msgid "Detail3EntryVarPoint2"
msgstr "For minimization, choose the non-basic variable with the most positive reduced cost coefficient."

msgid "Detail3PivotNote"
msgstr "The column containing the selected variable is called the pivot column."

msgid "Detail3ExampleNote"
msgstr "In the example, the entering variable is X₁ since it has the most negative value (–3) in the reduced cost vector:"

msgid "Detail4Summary"
msgstr "Select the Leaving Variable Using the Feasibility Condition"

msgid "Detail4FeasibilityTitle"
msgstr "Feasibility Condition"

msgid "Detail4FeasibilityDesc1"
msgstr "The feasibility condition is used to determine which basic variable will leave the basis and be replaced by the entering variable. This uses the minimum ratio test."

msgid "Detail4FeasibilityDesc2"
msgstr "The minimum ratio is calculated by dividing the value in column R by the value in the pivot column. The smallest ratio indicates the leaving variable."

msgid "Detail4FeasibilityDesc3"
msgstr "If the minimum ratio is negative or zero, no basic variable can leave the basis and the problem has no solution."

msgid "Detail4ExitVarTitle"
msgstr "Leaving Variable"

msgid "Detail4ExitVarDesc1"
msgstr "To identify the leaving variable, divide each R value by its corresponding pivot column coefficient, provided that coefficient is positive."

msgid "Detail4ExitVarDesc2"
msgstr "The smallest result corresponds to the pivot row, which contains the leaving variable."

msgid "Detail4Example1"
msgstr "In our example, the pivot column is for entering variable X₁. The pivot row is the one with the smallest ratio (18/3=6), corresponding to S₂."

msgid "Detail4Example2"
msgstr "Thus, the leaving variable is S₂. The intersection of pivot row and pivot column gives the pivot element; here it is 3."

msgid "Detail5Summary"
msgstr "Update the Matrix"

msgid "Detail5Intro"
msgstr "Once our pivot element is determined, we perform Gauss-Jordan operations to form the identity matrix. The new value for each row is calculated as follows:"

msgid "Detail5PivotTitle"
msgstr "For the pivot row:"

msgid "Detail5PivotDesc"
msgstr "The new pivot row value is obtained by dividing its current value by the pivot element."

msgid "Detail5OtherTitle"
msgstr "For the other rows:"

msgid "Detail5OtherDesc"
msgstr "The new row value is calculated by subtracting from its current value the product of the pivot column entry and the new pivot row value."

msgid "Detail5ExampleIntro"
msgstr "To illustrate, let's continue with the example. We begin with the pivot row:"

msgid "Detail5AfterpivotIntro"
msgstr "For the other rows, we perform calculations differently. We start with row S₁:"

msgid "Detail5RowS3Intro"
msgstr "For row S₃ we have:"

msgid "Detail5RowZIntro"
msgstr "Finally, for row Z we have:"

msgid "Detail5PostOperations"
msgstr "After performing Gauss-Jordan, our matrix becomes:"

msgid "Detail5MatrixIdentityDesc"
msgstr "As you can see, the pivot position is now 1 and the other entries in that column become 0. This begins forming our identity matrix."

msgid "Detail5ReturnStep"
msgstr "Return to step number 3"

msgid "Detail5ReturnDesc"
msgstr "With this result, we go back to step 3 and repeat the process. Since there are still negative values in the reduced cost vector, we can continue optimizing."

msgid "Detail5NegativeValueDesc"
msgstr "The only negative value is -4, so the entering variable will be X₂."

msgid "Detail5ChooseExitVarDesc"
msgstr "To choose the leaving variable, divide each R value by its corresponding X₂ column coefficient (the latter must be positive)."

msgid "Detail5IgnoreNegative"
msgstr "The X₂ column entry is negative, so it's not considered."

msgid "Detail5SmallestValueDesc"
msgstr "The smallest ratio occurs in row S₃, so that variable leaves the basis. The pivot element is 16/3."

msgid "Detail5NextIterationIntro"
msgstr "We perform another iteration and obtain the following result:"

msgid "Detail5OptReached"
msgstr "In this final tableau, the reduced cost vector has no negative entries, indicating we've reached the optimal solution. We'll extract the basic variables and Z as follows:"

msgid "Detail5NonBasisZero"
msgstr "Non-basic variables will have value 0."

msgid "Detail5Solution"
msgstr "Solution: X₁ = 31/4, X₂ = 21/8, S₁ = 51/8, S₂ = 0, S₃ = 0, Z = 57/2"
